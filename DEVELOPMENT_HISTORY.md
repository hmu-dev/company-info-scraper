# üöÄ AI Web Scraper - Development History

This document chronicles the complete development journey of the AI Web Scraper project, from initial concept to final standalone implementation.

## üìÖ Development Timeline

### Phase 1: Initial Setup & Basic Scraping (Start)

**User Request**: "let's start the app" ‚Üí "I would like to install and run the ai scrapper app"

**Challenges Encountered**:

- `externally-managed-environment` error during pip install
- Connection refused errors when starting Streamlit
- Streamlit email prompt blocking startup

**Solutions Implemented**:

- Created Python virtual environment (`python3 -m venv venv`)
- Activated virtual environment before installing dependencies
- Bypassed email prompt with configuration and piped input
- Created `.streamlit/config.toml` with `gatherUsageStats = false`

**Initial Working State**: Basic Streamlit app running with text-only scraping

### Phase 2: Media Extraction Enhancement

**User Request**: "Can this tool extract media. It does find the media I want, but the tool is not displaying the media files in the UI. Can we adjust the UI to save and show the media."

**Features Added**:

- `download_media()` function for downloading images and videos
- `extract_media_from_html()` for direct HTML parsing of media URLs
- Media filtering for company branding (logos, team photos, etc.)
- `scraped_media/` directory creation and management
- UI sections for displaying downloaded images and videos separately
- Download links for each media file

**Technical Implementation**:

- Added imports: `requests`, `os`, `json`, `urljoin`, `urlparse`, `base64`, `BytesIO`, `PIL.Image`, `BeautifulSoup`, `re`
- Media type detection based on file extensions and content-type headers
- Base64 encoding for media display in Streamlit
- Error handling for failed media downloads

### Phase 3: UI Improvements

**User Request**: "I would like the prompt input field to be a text field that expands. I would like it to wrap the text instead of having it all on one line and the input box should expand to a maximum height of 400px and then scroll if input is larger."

**UI Enhancements**:

- Changed `st.text_input` to `st.text_area` with `height=150`, `max_chars=2000`
- Added custom CSS for expandable text area behavior:
  ```css
  .stTextArea > div > div > textarea {
    resize: vertical;
    min-height: 150px;
    max-height: 400px;
    overflow-y: auto;
  }
  ```

### Phase 4: Video Support Extension

**User Request**: "I would also like to be able to extract, save and display video media files as well as images."

**Video Features Added**:

- Extended `download_media()` to handle video formats (mp4, webm, avi, mov, mkv, flv, m4v)
- Video detection in HTML parsing (`<video>`, `<source>` tags)
- Separate video display section in UI with `st.video()`
- Content-type based file extension assignment for videos

### Phase 5: Robust Error Handling & Smart Navigation

**User Request**: Error occurred - "src property must be a valid json object" when scraping about-us URLs

**Advanced Features Implemented**:

- `find_about_page()` function for intelligent site navigation
- Multi-URL scraping strategy (original URL ‚Üí discovered About page)
- Comprehensive error handling with try-catch blocks around entire scraping process
- Content validation to ensure meaningful extraction
- Fallback mechanisms when AI scraping fails
- Navigation link analysis for finding About/Company pages

**Error Resilience**:

- Graceful handling of asyncio event loop conflicts
- Fallback to media extraction even when text scraping fails
- Smart URL discovery from navigation menus
- Common path checking (/about, /about-us, /company, etc.)

### Phase 6: API Development

**User Request**: Request to create FastAPI version for programmatic access

**FastAPI Implementation**:

- Created `api.py` with FastAPI application
- Defined Pydantic models (`ScrapeRequest`, `MediaItem`, `ScrapeResponse`)
- Integrated all scraping functionality into REST endpoint
- Base64 encoding of media for JSON response
- Structured response format with success status, content, and media

**API Features**:

- `/scrape` POST endpoint accepting URL and optional parameters
- Health check endpoint at root `/`
- Interactive API documentation at `/docs`
- Comprehensive error handling and response formatting

### Phase 7: Public Hosting & Deployment

**User Request**: "now how can I launch the ui on a server so that I can have people outside of my network test it?"

**Deployment Solutions Explored**:

1. **Streamlit Community Cloud** (GitHub required)
2. **ngrok** (failed due to authentication requirements)
3. **serveo.net** (successful solution)

**Public Access Implementation**:

- Created `start_public_server.sh` script for automated public hosting
- Implemented process management (killing existing processes)
- SSH tunneling through serveo.net for public URL generation
- Background process handling for Streamlit and tunnel services

**Script Features**:

- Automatic cleanup of existing processes
- Health checks for Streamlit startup
- Public URL generation and display
- Process ID tracking for easy management

### Phase 8: API Key Hardcoding & Security

**User Request**: "Can we make a change so that my public key is already set in the code so that the user does not need to input the OpenAI API key?"

**Security Implementation**:

- **Streamlit**: Used `st.secrets` management with `.streamlit/secrets.toml`
- **FastAPI**: Implemented `DEFAULT_OPENAI_API_KEY` constant with optional override
- Graceful fallback to manual input if secrets not configured
- Success/warning messages for API key status

**Configuration**:

```python
# Streamlit approach
try:
    openai_access_token = st.secrets["secrets"]["OPENAI_API_KEY"]
    st.success("‚úÖ OpenAI API Key loaded successfully!")
except Exception:
    st.warning("‚ö†Ô∏è API key not configured. Please enter manually:")
    openai_access_token = st.text_input("OpenAI API Key", type="password")

# FastAPI approach
DEFAULT_OPENAI_API_KEY = "sk-proj-..."
api_key = request.openai_api_key or DEFAULT_OPENAI_API_KEY
```

### Phase 9: Hardcoded Company Profile Prompt

**User Request**: Hard-code comprehensive company profile extraction prompt

**Default Prompt Implementation**:

```text
Please extract information from the provided website to create a company profile.
Organize the extracted content into the following four distinct sections, ensuring
each section is clearly delineated and contains relevant details:

About Us (including locations): This section should provide a concise overview of
the company, its mission, and its primary activities. Crucially, identify and list
all physical locations associated with the company.

Our Culture: Describe the core values, working environment, and overall ethos of
the company. Look for descriptions of how the company operates, its philosophy,
and what it emphasizes in its internal and external interactions.

Our Team: Identify key individuals, leadership, or significant roles within the
company. If specific team members are highlighted, include their names and
relevant contributions or backgrounds.

Noteworthy & Differentiated: This section is for unique selling propositions,
special features, awards, or any aspects that make the company stand out from
its competitors. Look for innovative services, unique offerings, or distinctive
operational models.

For each section, aim for clear, descriptive language. The overall profile should
be comprehensive yet concise, suitable for a mobile app experience. Pay close
attention to details that highlight the company's identity and what makes it unique.
keep the response less than 500 words. Additionally, extract any media (videos and
images) that are relevant to company branding (i.e. logos, and media about the
company) These images will be used to populate an about-us section for the given
company in a recruiting app. Please provide the media in the response.
```

**Implementation Details**:

- Pre-filled in Streamlit `st.text_area` with `value=default_prompt`
- Increased text area height to 200px and max_chars to 3000
- Same prompt integrated into FastAPI for consistency
- Users can still modify the prompt if needed

### Phase 10: Standalone Project Creation

**User Request**: "I need to extract all of the code related to this scraper tool that we have been working on and put it in it's own workspace"

**Standalone Project Structure**:
